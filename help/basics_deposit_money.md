### 2. Deposit Litecoin

In your Litecoin wallet or on the website of the service you used to purchase Litecoin, enter the address copied in step 1.

**As noted** please don't reuse the generated address!  If you need to deposit money again, repeat step 2 to get a new deposit address.

The money may take some time to appear in your account.  You should see your balance updated a bit after the transaction has 6 confirmations.
