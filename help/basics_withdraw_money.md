<!-- Withdraw Money -->

To withdraw money you'll need to have a Litecoin wallet set up or an account at a service such as a Litecoin exchange.

### 1. Create a Litecoin receive address

In either your wallet software or the Litecoin service you use create a receive address.

### 2. Select `Scan` on the micromicro home screen

If you have a camera you can scan the address QR code.  Otherwise, copy the text address and paste it into the `Paste` tab in micromicro.

### 3. Enter the amount you want to withdraw and press `Withdraw`

Note that you can't withdraw an amount that's a fraction of the minimum denomination of a Litecoin. The default transfer fee is deducted from the amount you enter.
