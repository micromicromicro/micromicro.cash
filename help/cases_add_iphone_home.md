<!-- Add an Icon to Your iPhone Home Screen -->

Adding a micromicro icon to your home screen makes opening the app easy to access.

### 1. Open the micromicro web app to its home screen

The home screen icon will open to the screen you're currently looking at, so the home screen is probably a good choice.

### 2. Press the share button at the bottom
