<!-- Security Best Practices -->

Handling money always has risks, especially online.  Here are some tips for preventing loss and avoiding risk by using micromicro.

* **Only deposit what you need.**  If you think you might buy a couple dollars worth of goods a week, don't deposit more than $50.

* **Keep the rest of your money in a secure Litecoin wallet.**  Investing in a physical wallet such as a [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) adds another layer of protection.

* **Use multiple accounts.**  Store more money in the account you use at home and less in the account you use on your phone.  Transferring money between the two is cheap.

* **Don't log into your account on public computers.**  You can make payments from your phone by scanning the QR code.

* **Download each transaction.**  The downloaded file can be used as a proof of purchase.
