<!-- Parts of the Application -->

micromicro is pretty simple but it might be unclear how to use some of its features when you're starting.  This guide will explain the general application organization and some of the more subtle features.

### 1. Home screen

![Home screen](parts_home_screen.jpg)

1. Your username

2. Your balance. If you use the account on multiple devices or have recently deposited money (and in some other situations) this might not be up to date. Press the `Refresh` button (8.) to get the latest number.

    Groups of three digits are separated by a space to make it easy to count them.  By default it's displayed in Litecoin but you can change to an estimate in other currencies in `Settings` (9.).

3. Scan: Use this to scan micromicro and Litecoin address QR codes (or to paste the addresses in directly).  If you scan a micromicro `in` address, you can send money.  If you scan a micromicro `out` address you can receive the money.  If you scan a Litecoin address, you can withdraw money.

4. New (In): An `in` in micromicro parlance is an address that allows other people to send you money. Use this tool to create an `in`.

5. New (Out): An `out` in micromicro parlance is an address that allows other people to take money you offer. You can use this to send money to someone who hasn't created an `in`, or to attach the money to something (such as an email).

6. Deposit: Create a Litecoin address for depositing money into your account.  You can use the address to withdraw money from an exchange directly into your account or to send money from wallet software.

7. List: List `in`s and `out`s you've created, recent addresses you've scanned, and recent transactions to or from your account.  You can delete `in`s and `out`s from the list (the money in a deleted `out` returns to you).

8. Refresh: Refresh downloaded information such as your current balance and exchange rates.

9. Settings: Change account settings, your preferred display currency, etc.

10. Log out: Log the current user out and return to the login screen.

### 2. Scanning

![Scan screen (1)](parts_scan_screen.jpg)

1. Scan an address QR code with your phone camera or a webcam.  Make sure the squares in the 3 corners are fully in the image and try to hold your hand steady.

    When the application recognizes the code you will automatically be taken to the relevant screen.

2. If you don't have a camera or you have a text address, select the `Paste` tab and paste the address in the text box, then press `Go`.

### 3. Forms

micromicro uses data entry forms in several locations, such as when creating an `in` or `out`.

micromicro forms have a number of unique features.

1. <img alt="The plus" class="inline" src="/app/plus.svg">: This line in the form is optional.  Press the <img alt="plus button" class="inline" src="/app/plus.svg"> to select it.

2. <img alt="The minus" class="inline" src="/app/minus.svg">: This line in the form is optional and selected by default.  Press the <img alt="minus button" class="inline" src="/app/minus.svg"> to deselect it.

3. <img alt="The question mark" class="inline" src="/app/minus.svg">: Click on this button to toggle explanations for the lines in the form.
