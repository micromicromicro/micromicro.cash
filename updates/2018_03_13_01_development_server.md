<!-- 2018-03-13T10:05:42.235177+00:00 Development Server -->

We launched a [development server](https://development.micromicro.cash/) recently for public development and testing integrations.  The server uses [testnet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet) Litecoin and has less redundancy than the production server but otherwise functions the same. Go try your idea out today!
